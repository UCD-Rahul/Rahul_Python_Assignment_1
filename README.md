This repository contains the spectrum data for the space detector lab 
python assignment and my code (rahul_python_assignment.py).


The code prints the detector information and optimal parameters of the 
emission line from curve_fit in the terminal. It also displays the 3 required plots of the spectrum,
the spectrum with the continuum fit overplotted and the spectrum with the continuum and emission line fit
overplotted.

To run it:

python rahul_python_assignment.py spectrum.txt 

or

python rahul_python_assignment.py 'spectrum.txt'

should work
